# True MMO

yeah, im just making perfect MMORPG in my view

*but im not a designer so its 3d game with  2d pixel-art sprites*

## Installation

create folder ./builds and ./client/precompiled
Use makefile to compile&run.

```bash
make run
```
use -jN flag, where n is ~number of threads you have
## Usage

Is there? You cant really play mmo without server. And i didnt implement any yet

## Features

Realtime raytracing* (even if you dont have RT cores)
*I am just too lazy for complicated light calculations so i stick to raytracing*

*Path tracing
