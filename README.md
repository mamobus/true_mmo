# True MMO

yeah, im just making perfect MMORPG in my view

*but im not a designer so its 3d game with  2d pixel-art sprites that are defenetly not stolen*

## Installation


Use makefile to init, compile and run.

```bash
make init
make run
```
use -jN flag for faster compilation, where n is ~number of threads you have

## Usage

Is there? You cant really play mmo without server. And i didnt host any yet

## Features

Realtime raytracing* (even if you dont have RT cores)
*I am just too lazy for complicated light calculations so i stick to raytracing*

*Path tracing
